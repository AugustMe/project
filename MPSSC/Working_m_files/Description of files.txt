%% Description of codes in the subdirectory.
%% SIMLR, Sparse SC, and t-SNE installation are required to run these m files.


Larger_MPSSC.m: runs MPSSC and PSSC for larger-scale data sets
doubly_vs_regular_place.m: comparisons of performances between doubly stochastic and regular affinity matrices
eigen_gap_part.m: estimating the number of clusters
pn_structure_place.m: comparisons of the target matrices for different SC methods
real_data_place.m: runs the 8 clustering methods for small-scale scRNA-seq data sets
real_data_place_large.m: runs the 6 clustering methods for large-scale data sets
robust_generator.m: performs PSSC and MPSSC by changing \lambda for robustness test
robust_generator_cs.m: performs PSSC and MPSSC by changing c for robustness test
robust_generator_large_k.m: performs MPSSC by changing k for robustness test (large-scale data sets)
robust_generator_large_rhos.m: performs MPSSC by changing \rho for large-scale data sets
robust_generator_rhos.m: performs PSSC and MPSSC by changing \rho for robustness test
simulation_model1.m: runs the six clustering methods for simulation model1
simulation_model2.m: runs the six clustering methods for simulation model2
