%% The following codes perform t-SNE algorithm

tsne.m performs symmetric t-SNE on dataset X.
d2p.m identifies appropriate sigma's to get kk NNs up to some tolerance.
tsne_d Performs symmetric t-SNE on the pairwise Euclidean distance matrix D.
tsne_p Performs symmetric t-SNE on affinity matrix P
x2p identifies appropriate sigma's to get kk NNs up to some tolerance.
