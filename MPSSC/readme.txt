MPSSC: Using Multiple kernels with pairwise and element-wise sparse spectral clustering  

MPSSC is a novel spectral clustering framework that imposes sparse structures on a target matrix. Specifically,it utilizes a doubly stochastic affinity matrix to construct a normalized graph Laplacian. Then, it imposes a sparse structure on the target matrix followed by shrinking pairwise differences of the rows in the target matrix. This spectral clustering method uses multiple similarity matrices via non-convex optimization framework. The proposed non-convex problem iteratively using the ADMM algorithm.
